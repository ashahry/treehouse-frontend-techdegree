In this project, I'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout should demonstrate a responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

I will write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, Iâ€™ll add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
