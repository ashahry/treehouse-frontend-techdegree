## Photo Gallery

In this project, I am creating an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos are provided with descriptions.

At the top of the page, I will have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos. The gallery should be responsive to all devices.
